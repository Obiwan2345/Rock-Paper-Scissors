# Rock Paper Scissors
This simple python game allows the user to play rock paper scissors with the computer. Fully interactive and easy to understand.
A score counter is also added so the user knows who is winning.

# How it Works
- The user picks a game mode; whether they want to play unlimited games or they want to do first to 5 or first to 10 with the computer.
- The user then picks rock, paper or scissors
- The computer then also randomly picks from the options
- If the computer wins, it prints: *Computer picks (option), computer wins* same with the user if they win.
- If first to 5 was clicked, the winner after winning five rounds will be displayed like: *player won* or *computer won*. Same with first to 10 after winning 10 rounds
- Also if unlimited is clicked, the score can still be accessed in the show score option. Same with other game modes.
