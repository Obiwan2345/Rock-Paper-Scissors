# Rock Paper Scissors
This simple python game allows the user to play rock paper scissors with the computer.
A score counter is also added so the user knows who is winning.

# How it Works
The user clicks one of the button option - rock, paper or scissors
The computer then also randomly picks from the options
If the computer wins, it prints: *Computer picks (option), computer wins* And the score is printed on the top of the window
The user can also click play again if they wish to have another go, with the score still being saved!
